# Interior Design AR App

The Interior Design AR App is a graduation project that utilizes the Lidar sensor of the iPhone to create an augmented reality (AR) experience for interior design enthusiasts. The app allows users to extract room walls, furniture, and openings, along with their positions, transformations, and rotations, using the Lidar sensor. It then reconstructs the room in the app using SceneKit, providing users with a virtual environment where they can design and visualize their dream room.

## Features

- Room Extraction: Utilize the Lidar sensor of the iPhone to accurately extract room dimensions, including walls, furniture, and openings.
- Room Reconstruction: Rebuild the room in the app using SceneKit, creating a virtual representation for designing and customization.
- Furniture Manipulation: Change the position and rotation of furniture within the room, giving users the freedom to design and arrange their furniture according to their preferences.
- Color and Texture Customization: Modify the colors and textures of furniture and walls, allowing users to experiment with different styles and aesthetics.
- 3D Model Replacement: Replace the furniture with alternative 3D models, enabling users to explore different shapes and designs.
- Custom Dimensions: Add new furniture with custom dimensions, empowering users to create their ideal room based on their specific requirements.
- AR Visualization: Experience the designed room in augmented reality, providing a realistic and immersive preview of the final result.
- User-Friendly Interface: The app is designed to be easy to use, making it accessible for users without prior design experience.
- Furniture Layout Optimization: Implement a reinforcement learning model to optimize furniture layout based on common rules, such as maintaining appropriate distances from doors and windows.
